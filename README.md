## WORD COUNTER AND MORE PROJECT

In this simple project, you have three main things: word counter, letter counter, and voice to read the paragraph.

# Technologies I am using in this project:

- HTML for structuring
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for logic

**FUTURE WORK**

- being able to find and highlight specific word/letter
